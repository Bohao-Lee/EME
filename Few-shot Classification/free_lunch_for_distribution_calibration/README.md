## Backbone Training

We use the same backbone network and training strategies as 'S2M2_R'. Please refer to https://github.com/nupurkmr9/S2M2_fewshot for the backbone training.


## Extract and save features

After training the backbone as 'S2M2_R', extract features as below:

- Create an empty 'checkpoints' directory.

- Run:
```save_features
python save_plk.py --dataset [miniImagenet/CUB] 
```
### Or you can directly download the extracted features/pretrained models from the link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IjqOYLRH0OwkMZo8Tp4EG02ltDppi61n?usp=sharing


After downloading the extracted features, please adjust your file path according to the code.


## Evaluate our distribution calibration

To evaluate our distribution calibration method, run:

```eval
python evaluate_DC.py
```
